Draft a schedule for a month’s schedule with 2 8 hour shifts per weekday (8am - 3 pm or 1pm to 9pm) and 1 8 hour shift on a weekend (8am to 4 pm) to be filled by 3 FTE pharmacists. Here are few other criterias: 
Try to make it as fair as possible with almost equal division of AM and PM shifts. 
One weekend day being covered by a per diem.
Senior most employee (S) is 0.6 FTE
Other 2 FTE(A and D) are 0.8 FTE. 
All three FTE rotate one weekend day. 
All three FTEs rotate one Friday PM shift.
FTE D is 2nd in line in seniority and would prefer to not do more than 2 PM shifts/week. 
Senior most FTE S would like to not work any other Friday but her scheduled rotation. 
There are 4 per diems. Two of the per diems only work 1 saturday per month. One per diem prefers working Sundays.
